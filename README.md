# Hospital-Info-System-SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation and management of a SQL-based Hospital Information System. It focuses on structuring a database that includes `Hospital` and `Doctor` tables and demonstrates complex SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.

## Database Schema
- `sql_scripts`: Contains SQL scripts for creating the database schema, adding sample data, and performing various data manipulation tasks.

## Features
- Adding sample records to the database.
- Fetching hospital and doctor information using specific IDs.
- Listing doctors based on specialty and salary.
- Updating doctor experience in years.

## Documentation
- `docs`: Includes detailed documentation and project reports outlining the database schema, SQL queries used, and insights from the data analysis.

## Getting Started
To run these scripts, you'll need access to a SQL server. Follow the instructions in the `docs` folder for setup and execution details.

## Tools Used
- SQL Server: For database creation and management.
- Any text editor or SQL management tool (e.g., SSMS, DBeaver) for editing and running SQL scripts.
